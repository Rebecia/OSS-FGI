## Documentation

### Extract_FGI

We have written the front-end of the webpage type. We have two extraction modes: **online** or **offline**.  
You need to enter the file (`.txt`) address or folder address respectively to perform batch processing to extract information.

### Data_Analysis

#### Classifer_BaseOnNPM

Contains code and dataset for classifier training (NPM ecosystem):

- **word2vec_embedding**  
  Embed many kinds of text data as vectors.

- **machine_learing_4kinds**  
  Use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to learn and classify vectors.

- **end_result**  
  Metadata, static, dynamic, and all 3 machine/deep learning result data.

- **other folder**  
  - Word-text dataset  
  - Embedding-vector dataset  
  - The dataset with `noget` in the name represents the dataset after removing the empty data in static.

#### Data_acquisition

Contains dataset we extracted and the extraction method:

- **get_all_sum**  
  Get all types of data (name, OSS, description, author, maintainer, URL, dependencies number, Static_APIs, Dynamic_APIs).

- **Dynamic_msg_ip**  
  Count the number of messages and IP addresses in dynamic API.


- **Data_acquisition** contains dataset we extracted and the extraction method
  - get_all_sum: get all types of data(name, OSS, description, author, maintainer, URL, dependencies number, Static_APIs, Dynamic_APIs).
  - Dynamic_msg_ip: count the number of messages and IP addresses in the dynamic API.
  - other folder: Statistical dataset.
